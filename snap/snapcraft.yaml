summary: A simple color chooser written in GTK3 (like gcolor2)
description: |
  Ever wanted to know the value of that color on your screen? Gcolor3 enables
  you to pick the color from any pixel on your screen. It also offers a palette,
  so that you can easily mix and match a couple of colors together.

  When you have found the perfect combination of colors, naturally you want to
  save them. Gcolor3 allows you to conveniently save and retrieve colors.

  Gcolor3 is a color selection dialog written in GTK+ 3. It is much alike
  Gcolor2, but uses the newer GTK+ version and other modernisations to better
  integrate into your modern desktop.
